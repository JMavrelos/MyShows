# MyShows
If you wish to run this project on your own you have to update it with your youtube and moviedb api keys

To do so go to the folder C:\Users\<username>\.gradle and create or open the file gradle.properties

In there append the lines:


MyShows_ApiKey="(movie db key)"

MyShows_Youtube_ApiKey="(youtube api key)"
